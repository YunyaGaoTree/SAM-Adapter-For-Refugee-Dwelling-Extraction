    "This notebook shows how to segment refugee dwellings from high-resolution satellite imagery using the Segment Anything Model (SAM).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The codes are adapted based on [SAM Adapter](https://github.com/tianrun-chen/SAM-Adapter-PyTorch) for training and [segment-geospatial](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-geospatial) for creating prediceted masks in the format of GeoTIFF and polygons in the format of ShapeFile.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Google Colab, make sure you use GPU runtime for this notebook. Go to `Runtime` -> `Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as the hardware accelerator.For training, it is better to use A100 GPU for the sake of memory and efficiency. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "These codes can be easily adapted for binary semantic segmentation applications in remote sensing. Feel free to use it for your own applications and implement in your local machine.<br>"
